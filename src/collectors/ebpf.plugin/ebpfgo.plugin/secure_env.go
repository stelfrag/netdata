// when it is started by anything other than the daemon its environment comes from
// a caller with fewer privileges than it runs with. Every variable read through
// here names a directory the plugin then loads eBPF objects from or reads
// configuration out of as root, so while privileged the environment is ignored and
// the caller falls back to its compiled-in default - the same directory the daemon
// would have pointed us at, since both derive from the install prefix.
//
// This must answer the same question as nd_secure_getenv() on the C side, so that
// the two plugins obey one contract.

// fallback is the compiled-in directory used when the environment cannot be

// drops to its own user before spawning us, so the exec is privileged on every
// start - and it costs nothing while the two agree. It is reported only when they

// leaving CapEff empty, and the kernel still marks that exec secure, so judging by
// CapEff alone would trust an environment the C side rejects.

// counts that on its own, even when those capabilities add nothing to what the
// caller already had. That bit is not recoverable from /proc/self/status, because
// CapEff == CapPrm looks identical whether the file set it or the caller's ambient
// set did - so any effective capability held by a non-root process is treated as a
